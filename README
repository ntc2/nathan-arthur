Installing Curry on Ubuntu
==========================

Warning: it appears you can't move the pakcs dir after running make,
so make sure the pakcs dir is where you want it.

$ sudo aptitude install rlwrap swi-prolog
$ wget http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~pakcs/download/pakcs_Linux.tar.gz
$ tar xf pakcs_Linux.tar.gz
$ cd pakcs
$ make # and enter "y" at the prompt

The curry executable is now at ./bin/pakcs.  There is an emacs mode in
./tools/emacs.
